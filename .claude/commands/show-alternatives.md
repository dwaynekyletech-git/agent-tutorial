# Show Alternatives Command

When I use `/show-alternatives [current code]`, demonstrate different approaches:

1. Show 2-3 different ways to implement the same functionality
2. Explain the pros and cons of each approach
3. Let me choose which one to use and why
4. Implement my choice while explaining the differences
5. Connect to broader architectural patterns

This helps me understand there are always multiple valid solutions.
