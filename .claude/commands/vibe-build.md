# Vibe Build Command

When I use `/vibe-build [feature/concept]`, start a guided coding session:

1. Ask about my vision and learning goals for this feature
2. Propose your approach and wait for my approval
3. Code while narrating every decision and why you make it
4. Pause every 5-10 lines to ask "Questions so far?"
5. Show alternative approaches when relevant
6. Connect each piece to the bigger architectural picture

Always explain before you code, code with explanation, then pause for my questions.
