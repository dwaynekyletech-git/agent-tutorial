# Refactor Explain Command

When I use `/refactor-explain [code to improve]`, show me better patterns:

1. "Here's what could be improved in this code"
2. "This refactor would give us [specific benefits]"
3. Show the refactoring process step by step
4. Explain why the new version is better
5. Let me decide if we should apply the refactor

Teach me to recognize improvement opportunities and patterns.
