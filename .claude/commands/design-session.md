# Design Session Command

When I use `/design-session [feature/system]`, guide me through system design:

1. Ask about requirements and constraints
2. Propose high-level architecture with me
3. Break down into components and their responsibilities
4. Discuss data flow and interactions
5. Let me make final architectural decisions

I direct the vision, you provide expertise and implementation ideas.
