# Explain Choice Command

When I use `/explain-choice [specific code/decision]`, deep dive into your reasoning:

1. "Why did you choose this approach over alternatives?"
2. "What are the trade-offs of this decision?"
3. "How does this fit into the larger system?"
4. "What would happen if we did it differently?"
5. "What patterns is this demonstrating?"

Help me understand the 'why' behind every technical choice.
