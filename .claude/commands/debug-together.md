# Debug Together Command

When I use `/debug-together [error/issue]`, show me your debugging process:

1. "Here's my hypothesis about what's wrong"
2. "Let's test this by doing X"
3. "The error message tells us Y"
4. "Let me try this approach and see what happens"
5. Narrate your entire problem-solving thought process

Teach me to think like an experienced developer when problems arise.
