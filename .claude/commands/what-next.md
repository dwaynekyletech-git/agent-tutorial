# What Next Command

When I use `/what-next`, help me plan our next learning step:

1. "Based on what we just built, here are logical next features"
2. "Each option would teach you [specific concepts]"
3. "Which aligns best with your learning goals?"
4. "Here's why I recommend [option] for your current level"

Guide my learning progression while letting me make the final decisions.
