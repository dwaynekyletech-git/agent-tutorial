# Session Wrap Command

When I use `/session-wrap`, help me consolidate learning:

1. "Today we built [features] using [patterns/technologies]"
2. "The key concepts you observed were [list]"
3. "You should now understand [specific learning outcomes]"
4. "Next session, let's build [suggestion] to explore [new concept]"
5. Ask me what confused me or what I want to explore deeper

End every session with clear learning takeaways and next steps.
