# Break It Down Command

When I use `/break-it-down [complex code]`, help me understand by:

1. "This code does X, Y, and Z - which part is confusing?"
2. Break complex code into smaller, understandable chunks
3. Explain each piece in plain English
4. Show how the pieces work together
5. Ask me to explain it back in my own words

Never move forward until I can explain what we just built.
