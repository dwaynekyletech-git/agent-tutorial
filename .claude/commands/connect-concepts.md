# Connect Concepts Command

When I use `/connect-concepts [current work]`, help me see the bigger picture:

1. "This pattern is similar to [other pattern] we used earlier"
2. "This connects to [broader concept] in this way"
3. "You'll see this same approach when we build [future feature]"
4. "This is a common pattern in [TypeScript/Next.js/AI development]"

Help me build a mental framework of interconnected concepts.
